      <h2>What is Lifeline?</h2>
      <p>Lifeline is an easy-to-use personal emergency response system that lets you summon help any time of the day or
        night,
        even if you can't speak. All you have to do is press your Personal Help Button, worn on a wristband or pendant
        and a
        Personal Response Associate will ensure you get help fast.</p>
      <h2>Live independently at home with Lifeline Medical Alert Servic</h2>
      <p>This year 1.4 million people, 65 and older will fall. If you or a loved one experience a medial emergency, time
        is of
        the essence. We can help by connecting you to the right help for the situation, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year
        at the
        push of a button. Whether you need emergency services or just the assistance of a family member or friend to
        help you
        get back on your feet, we can help.</p>
      <h2>If a fall should happen</h2>
      <p>Not all falls can be prevented. If a fall does occur, older adults need to be sure they can reach help easily
        and
        quickly, especially if they are injured, in order to prevent further injury and dangerous complications.</p>
      <img src="images/If-a-fall-should-happen.jpg" alt="If-a-fall-should-happen">
      <p>The Comox Valley Lifeline Society offers a variety of medical alert services designed specifically for older

        service to the
